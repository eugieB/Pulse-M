            How did this company start. It was founded on a lenovo laptop 
            with a office in sunnyside road. with clear blue skies. I had 
            ray bans on with a lipbum, thankfully. The system had all the correct languages
            but lacked the CSS. I had myself and the boses's chiuwhuwhu to start at
            the training stopped. I could only see clusters of words through laptop.
            cars as they passed by the office made the place more scenic more with a tasty vanilla
            bar. Bar please. Neo was nowhere am i wrong?

                Many years had passed before I lost my world in the hills led by colonel 
                accent(favourite car). He was formiable by every waking day, with great power I dominate the 
                the vast streets of hims and hers, I saw one the naked eye protest too end something. God took the colonel away into a 
                new hill. Valentines was nearly over. Dont lose the age of enlightenment to 
                a wannabe hero. Alast the road waits for my feet to be its friend.
                Shoult I be... any better? I mean is work place was too interesting for a morning call.
